# Hybrid-Algorithm-of-optimization
For the algorithm of optimization where there is the random method, it can be strong at finding the global optimization rather than being 
trapped in the local optimisation, howerver, the acuracy is not really satisfying. And  for the algorithm classic, like the gradient method,
it can get the optimization acurately, but it is really easy to get trapped in the local optimisation. So here, these two kinds of algorithms
are hybride. For the first step,  algorithm of optimization with random element is used to get the minimum area, and then based on its result, 
the algorithm of grandient is used to get the result more accurate.
